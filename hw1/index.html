    <p>Hi I am Yasmeen and I am finishing up my computer science degree this semester. I have learned a lot at school but it still is not enough! I work at a plant nursery but am looking to apply for internships soon. My favorite places are the beach, the mountains, and anywhere with my friends. I enjoy gardening and puzzles in my free time. I hope to have some more free time soon!</p>
