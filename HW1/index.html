    <p>Hi I am Yasmeen and I am finishing up my computer science <br> 
      degree at College of San Mateo this semester. I have learned a <br> 
      lot at CSM but it still is not enough! I work at a plant nursery <br> 
      but am looking to apply for internships soon. I enjoy gardening <br> and puzzles in my free time.</p>
    <p>I am attending this class because it is relevant to my major <br> 
      and I am super interested in having the skills and knowledge <br> 
      behind mobile web app development. Broadening my computer science <br> abilities is a big goal of mine and I hope to be proficient.</p>
