<p><img src="cool.png" alt="cartoon with a paint bucket in the process of painting a large 3D text saying 'WWW.', signifies working on the web">Progressive Web Applications are a step up from native applications and are not distributed through a mobile app store. They can be downloaded from the website settings as a shortcut icon on your desktop. There is another option to add notifications for the user. The service worker will engage with push events sent from the server to update a user with push notifications in real time. They do not need to have the web app actively open. To go along with the service worker supporting the PWA, a manifest.json file is also necessary and contains all the properties that will be sent to the browser to edit the appearance of the web app.
</p>
    <p>Some advantages of PWA's; they are of high processing speed. Your page can be loaded faster for the users smooth viewing experience. They are secure because they refuse to run unless it is over a https secure server unless you are using a localhost because those are always secure. PWA's are also of great use because they can use service workers to cache all the important aspects to keep a site running on or offline. Since a main aspect of websites are user engagement, having the capability of using your site offline would keep users on the site. A main association with PWA's is the icon package that should be sized accordingly and cached. This will be the logo of your application that the user views so having different sizes is crucial for different viewing experiences.
